# PAQCompress

PAQCompress is a GUI of the powerful PAQ compression software. Originally written in 2009, it has been rewritten to provide a better GUI and include the latest and greatest PAQ versions.

Supported PAQ versions are: 

* paq8o10t
* paq8kx
* paq8pf
* paq8px
* paq8pxd
* fp8

The software appends the PAQ series and version to the output filename and this allows the GUI to select the proper version to use when extracting the file.
